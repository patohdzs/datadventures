# Data Science Adventures

This repository contains exploratory data science projects, with the purpose of documenting my learning. Comments and suggestions are always welcome and greatly appreciated!

## Current projects:

- #### [Final Offer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patohdzs/data-science-adventures/blob/main/final-offer/residential-real-estate-price-prediction.ipynb)
  - Project focused on forecasting house prices in the region of Ames, Iowa.
  - Uses a variety of supervised learning models, including regularized regressions, gradient boosted trees, and random forests, as well as a final estimator stacking approach.
  - Predictions placed in the top 1% of submissions for the Kaggle Housing Prices Competition.
  - Data collected by Dean De Cock from individual residential property sales between 2006 - 2010.

- #### (ONGOING) How Bad Dit It Shake?
  - Project aimed at predicting the level of building damages caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.
  - Focus on ordinal dependant variable models, assesed on a micro-averaged F1 score metric.
  - Data was collected as part of the [2015 Nepal Earthquake Open Data Portal project](http://eq2015.npc.gov.np/#/about) between January - May 2016 and preprocessed by DrivenData for the Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage competition.
